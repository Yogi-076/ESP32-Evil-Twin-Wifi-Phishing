## 1️⃣ Install ESP32 Board in Arduino IDE

1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Go to **File > Preferences**.
3. In **Additional Board Manager URLs**, paste:
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/espressif/arduino-esp32/gh-pages/package_esp32_index.json
   ```
4. Click **OK**.
5. Go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**.
6. Search for **ESP32** and install it.

## 2️⃣ Install SPIFFS File Upload Plugin

1. Download the ESP32FS Plugin from: 🔗 [**ESP32FS Plugin GitHub**](https://github.com/me-no-dev/arduino-esp32fs-plugin)
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file.
3. Move the extracted `ESP32FS` folder to:
   ```
   C:\Users\yourusername\Documents\Arduino\tools\
   ```
4. Restart **Arduino IDE**.
5. You should now see **Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload** in the menu.

---

## 3️⃣ Open the Project in Arduino IDE

1. Download the project from **GitHub** or copy it into your **Arduino sketch folder**.
2. Open **ESP32-Evil-Twin.ino** in **Arduino IDE**.
3. In **Tools > Board**, select **ESP32 WROOM**.
4. Set the correct **COM Port** from **Tools > Port**.

---

## 4️⃣ Upload the Phishing Page (SPIFFS)

1. In **Arduino IDE**, go to **Tools > ESP32 Sketch Data Upload**.
2. Wait until the **SPIFFS file system** is uploaded.

---

## 5️⃣ Upload the Code to ESP32

1. Click the **Upload** button (▶) in **Arduino IDE**.
2. Wait for the code to flash successfully.
3. Open **Serial Monitor** (**Tools > Serial Monitor**) and set **baud rate** to **115200**.

---

## 6️⃣ Test the Evil Twin Attack

1. After flashing, **ESP32 will create a fake WiFi network** named **"Shaktiman"** (you can change this in the code).
2. **Connect** to the **"Shaktiman"** WiFi network on any device.
3. Open **any website** → You should be redirected to the **fake login page**.
